## Supabase Setup

The application uses Supabase for backend services. To set up the database tables:

1. Navigate to your Supabase project dashboard
2. Go to the SQL editor
3. Either:
   - Run the SQL code in `supabase/schema.sql` to create all tables at once
   - Or run the migration file in `supabase/migrations/20240727_job_listings.sql` to create just the job listings table

### Fixing Common Errors

#### "relation "public.job_listings" does not exist" Error

If you see this error in the console, it means the job_listings table hasn't been created in your Supabase database:

1. Go to your Supabase SQL editor
2. Copy the contents of `supabase/migrations/20240727_job_listings.sql`
3. Paste and execute the SQL in the editor
4. Refresh your application
